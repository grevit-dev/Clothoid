# Dynamoid

Dynamoid is a set of Components for the visual coding environment Autodesk (R) Dynamo for creating [Clothoid or Euler spiral geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_spiral). This implementation uses Mamitko's C# Clothoid implementation that provides circle to circle and line to circle fitting.

## Clothoid Components

- ByCircleAndCircle: creates a clothoid by circle to circle fitting

- ByLineAndCircle: creates a clothoid by circle to line fitting

- ByParameters: creates a clothoid by input factors
